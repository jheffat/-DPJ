# üîê DPJ - CLI Data Cryptographic Tool

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jheffat/-DPJ/main/scrnsht/intro.png)

**DPJ** is a command-line data encryption tool, an improvement of [Fixor](https://github.com/jheffat/-FiXOR) 2.50(Discontinued). The Name Fixor changed to DPJ 
 in honor of the my first encryption tool developed in QBasic and Visual Basic (2003‚Äì2007), DPJ is faster, more secure, and packed with new features designed to keep your data safe. Is a lightweight CLI tool, encrypt/decrypt files securely using custom method, built with python. Good tool to encrypt your work projects or your sensitive data(documents, PDFs, photos, videos, etc.).

## ‚ö° Features

- üîí **Encrypt & Decrypt Files**, using strong cryptography
- üß† **Choose or Autogenerate Passphrase**, for encryption
- üîê **KDF-powered Key Derivation**, to resist brute-force attacks
- üßÇ **Secure Password Hashing with bcrypt**, stored in encrypted metadata
- üß¨ **Encrypted Metadata**, Used to protect internal config
- üîç **File Scan Mode**, to check encryption details
- ‚úÖ **File Integrity Verification**, a built-in verification step checks whether the decrypted data matches the original, ensuring the decryption process was successful.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Tamper Protection**, Files won‚Äôt be modified unless the passphrase is correct
- #Ô∏è‚É£ **Hash tools included**, Hash files/Msg using any theses algorithms (blake2b, sha3_512, sha256, sha1,  sha512, shake_128, shake_256, sha3_256, blake2s, md5), In the absence of a specified algorithm, the default SHA256 will be applied.

## üöÄ Performance

DPJ improves on Fixor with significantly faster encryption and decryption processes, optimized for modern systems and large files.

## üîß Installation

You can install DPJ, 
  
  ++by cloning this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jheffat/dpj.git
cd dpj
python3 -m pip install
``` 
  ++by using pypi [pypi.org/dpj...](https://pypi.org/project/dpj/) or:
```bash
pip install dpj
```
  ++By download and install executable for:

`*Windows`
[DPJ 3.0.7 Installer.exe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jheffat/DPJ/main/Bins/DPJ%203.0.7%20Installer.exe)  (Need to setup your anti-virus to allow using this app)

`*Linux Debian`
[DPJ_307LinuxDeb.deb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jheffat/DPJ/main/Bins/DPJ%203.0.7%20Installer.deb) (Link Dead**Fixing...)

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i DPJ_307LinuxDeb.deb
   ```



## üß™ Usage Examples
Encrypt all files including sub-directories with a key `#R3ds0ftwar3!len3zz`
```bash
dpj -e *.* -r -k #R3ds0ftwar3!len3zz    
```
Encrypt all files with the extension  `.JPG` on the current path `c:\pictures`
```bash
dpj -e  c:\pictures\*.jpg     
```
Decrypt all files including in sub-directories on the current local
```bash
dpj -d *.* -r  
```
scan all files including in sub-directories on the current local 
```bash
dpj -s *.* -r  
```
Hash all files using all algorithms
```bash
dpj -hs *.* -a all
```
Hash a text using md5
```bash
dpj -hs 'Life is Good' -a md5
```

## üîê Security Details

- KDF: Passphrases are transformed via a Key Derivation Function before use, making brute-force attempts extremely difficult.
- bcrypt: Passphrase hashes are stored using bcrypt to safely verify future attempts without revealing the key.
- No Overwrites: Files will not be altered if the provided passphrase is incorrect.
- Hash Verification: A post-decryption hash ensures that the data was correctly restored.

## üôå Acknowledgements
DPJ(Data protection Jeff), was my first encryption app crafted in QBasic(CLI) and Visual Basic(GUI) between 2003‚Äì2007. This project is a modern revival with more power, speed, and security, thanks to the powerful language PYTHON.
